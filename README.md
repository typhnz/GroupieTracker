Groupie Tracker Project started on 03/02/2023

## Members of the group

The group consisted of three people: Tayvadi, Tom and Charles.

## How to launch the project?

To start the project, you just have to go to Server by doing "cd Server" in the terminal. Once you have this, do go run server.go

## Features we'll improve in V2

In the future we want to add a functionnal search bar, we also want to add the paging because we don't have enought time and don't know how to do it.
With more time we probably have it. Actually we don't have the map on the details page, but on a clickable link.
