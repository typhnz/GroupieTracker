# GroupieTracker
Groupie Tracker Project started on 03/02/2023

## Members of the group

The group consisted of three people: Tayvadi, Tom and Charles.

## How to launch the project?

To start the project, you just have to go to Server by doing "cd Server" in the terminal. Once you have this, do go run server.go

## Features we'll improve in V2

In the next version we would like to add functional filters, a functional search bar. In addition we would like to add a link that would go directly to deezer or spotify, from the artist's characteristics page.
